When you open the file DO NOT DO ANYTHING YET.
Then at the bottem left corner put a check in the check box that is labled change destination folder.
Then click instal, then click Change... the type the location of Java Jar Opener and for me it is 
C:\Users\noahg\Desktop\Java .Jar opener. But then you need to add \java so that is is 
C:\Users\noahg\Desktop\Java .Jar opener\java then click instal and you are done with this folder
